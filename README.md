# School of Rock

School of Rock predicts future infrastructure needs,
based on robust data and enhanced statistical visualistion.

We hope that it is used by state and federal governments
in planning for future needs.

School of Rock is being created as part of
[Govhack 2015](https://www.govhack.org/govhack-2015),
a 48-hour hackathon.
